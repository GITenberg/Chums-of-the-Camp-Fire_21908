description: How many greenback saddles does that last bullfrog Max shot make, Toby!
  "" ""T-t-thirteen, all t-t-told, Steve. "" ""Ginger! that's going some for so early
  in the spring season, isn't it? I'd like to get about twenty before we quit, which
  would make just five for each of us, Max, Bandy-legs, you and myself. And seems
  like we ought to knock over seven more this Saturday afternoon. ""
